# AIML Pipeline

This project implements an end-to-end AI/ML pipeline using AWS services including Redshift, S3, SageMaker, and API Gateway.

## Project Structure

- `infrastructure/`: Terraform configurations for AWS resources
- `src/`: Source code for data extraction, model training, and API
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for model development
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the project

## Setup

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```

3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   cd infrastructure
   terraform init
   ```

4. Apply Terraform configuration:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

5. Once the infrastructure is set up, access SageMaker Studio:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console
   - Navigate to Amazon SageMaker
   - Click on "Studio" in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Open Studio" for your user profile

6. In SageMaker Studio:
   - Open a new notebook
   - Use the provided notebook templates in the `notebooks/` directory to start developing your ML models

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate and adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Security

Security is of the utmost importance for this project. While this is a demonstration project and not intended for production use, we still follow best practices:

- We use least-privilege permissions in our Terraform configurations
- Sensitive information is never hard-coded and should be managed through AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables
- Regular security audits of dependencies are conducted

If you discover any security issues, please email aws-security@amazon.com instead of using the issue tracker.

For production deployments, always refer to the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html) Security Pillar for comprehensive security best practices.
